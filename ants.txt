The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one !!!
The little one stops to suck his thumb
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom!

The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two
The little one stops to tie his shoe
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom! // I changed it!
