# R3 Technologies computer school
This repository is maintained by R3tec computer school. The school is targeting self learners who want to advance their professional level through participation in open source projects.

We are currently working on a small web project with React front end and C# backend. You can find the current state of the project in master-react branch. The project is open for contributors, but if you want to participate in our learning sessions or have discussion about implementation you will need to join our school. Our introductory course is free.

The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one
The little one stops to suck his thumb
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom!

The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two
The little one stops to tie his shoe
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom!

The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three
The little one stops to climb a tree
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom!
