The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching one by one
The little one stops to suck his thumb
And they all go marching down to the ground

The ants go marching two by two, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching two by two
The little one stops to tie his shoe
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom!

The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three, hurrah, hurrah
The ants go marching three by three
The little one stops to climb a tree
And they all go marching down to the ground
To get out of the rain, boom! Boom! Boom!
